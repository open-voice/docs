Like all open-source projects, contributions to OpenVoice are very welcome. As you'll learn, we are accepting contributions accross the entire project. 
So everyone can contribute in some way. 

### Who is a Contributor?
Contributors to OpenVoice are not limited to engineering or software devlopment only. Remember that OpenVoice is a speech-corpus and thus people contributing 
their voice are contributors too. Contributors also contribute written phrases and sentences in different languages. Contributors also review these written texts as well 
the voice translations in different languages.   
Have a text corpus you want to contribute? Then you're also a contributor, or maybe it's your organization that owns the data then the organization 
can be a contributor as well. 

### Become a contributor
