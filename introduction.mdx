## What is Open-Voice?

Open Voice is an open-source speech corpus that collects and provides high-quality speech data for African languages. Our goal is to close the significant data gap in African speech & linguistic resources, enabling the training and development of inclusive AI models for the diverse languages and dialects of the African continent, and preserving some endangered Africaâ€™s linguistic heritage.

African languages are significantly underrepresented in the existing dataset in the rapid advancements of artificial intelligence technologies. All mainstream models miss the awareness of African culture, don't understand our dialects and languages and African people are unable to benefit equitably from AI and speech technologies. 

Blame it on the scarcity of quality datasets. This scarcity impedes technological inclusivity and innovation, preventing many Africans from benefiting from modern AI-driven tools.

Open Voice tackles this problem by creating a comprehensive, community-driven speech corpus for African languages. By leveraging contributions from native speakers, linguists, and developers, we gather diverse and accurate speech data. Our platform ensures high-quality, reliable datasets are freely available for developing ASR systems, NLP applications, and educational tools.
