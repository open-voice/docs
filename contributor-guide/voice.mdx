Voice contributions are the essential part of the OpenVoice corpus. The way it works is that you will read a script (typically in English) and 
then provide (your) voice translation of the script in your chosen language. That's it.   
The script will typically be a sentence, phrase or at most a short paragraph.

### Rewards

Here are some ways we plan to `Gamify` the voice contributions;

**Earning points:** Earn points for each script read, earn bonus points for reading in underrepresented dialects or languages.  
**Daily Reading Quests:** Complete a set number of readings per day for streak bonuses.

This way, we can reward our most hardworking voice contributors. 

### Join the community
All voice contributions will be done through the mobile application, however you can join our community to get info, updates and join our meetups.
