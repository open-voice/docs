Finally, to ensure that the voice (speech), transcription and written contributions are accurate, users who signup as reviewers will listen, read and 
review these contributions for accuracy.  

### Rewards

Here's how we plan to `Gamify` the reviews;

**Voting Rewards:** Earn points for voting on the accuracy of transcriptions and translations.  
**Quality Assurance Quests:** Complete a series of quality assurance tasks to earn badges and extra points.
