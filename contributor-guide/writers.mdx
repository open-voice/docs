title: 'Writers'
---

While we can rely on some open-soure English text corpus to generate scripts for translation and we will also draw from dataset contributions. We want to give the 
community the opportunity to contribute scripts as well. For example, you can contribute niche phrases or expressions that you use in your informal 
conversations. Writers can contribute these phrases in either English or any African language. 

### Rewards

Hers's how we plan to `Gamify` the written contributions;

**Script Writing Points:** Earn points for writing and submitting new scripts or prompts that is upvoted 10 times, and a badge for a script that accepted in the corpus.
